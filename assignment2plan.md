## Planned Application (Brief Description)

Our planned application is an **online trading platform** for a fictitious company called **EcoTech Supplies**, which specializes in selling eco-friendly and sustainable technology products. The application will allow users to browse a dynamically updated product catalog, search for items using keywords or categories, and register for more personalized features.

Three types of users will be supported:

- **Visitors**: Can browse and search for products.
- **Registered Customers**: Can purchase products, manage their accounts, and track orders.
- **Company Staff**: Can add, update, or remove products from the database.

The system will use a server-side database to store all product details, ensuring data is retrieved dynamically for display in the client. This design supports scalability as new products can be added or existing products removed without modifying the client application.
